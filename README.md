# Installation 
From the instructions provided by [Warp Docs](https://docs.warp.dev/appearance/custom-themes): 

1. To start, create a config directory in your home directory:
`mkdir -p ~/.warp/themes/`
Note: It may take several minutes for Warp to initially discover the new config directory. You can either wait or just restart the application.

3. Add your new custom theme yaml theme file to this directory:
`cp ~/Downloads/copilot_dark_theme.yaml ~/.warp/themes/`
Your new theme should now be visible on the list of available themes.
